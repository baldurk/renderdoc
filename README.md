RenderDoc is a frame-capture based graphics debugger, currently available for Vulkan, D3D11, D3D12, OpenGL, and OpenGL ES development on Windows 7 - 10, Linux, Android, Stadia, and Nintendo Switch&trade;. It is completely open-source under the MIT license.

If you have any questions, suggestions or problems or you can [create an issue](https://github.com/baldurk/renderdoc/issues/new) here on github, [email me directly](mailto:baldurk@baldurk.org) or come into [IRC](https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/irc.oftc.net/#renderdoc) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/ahq6yRB) to discuss it.

* Nintendo Switch&trade; support is distributed separately for authorized developers as part of the NintendoSDK. For more information, consult the Nintendo Developer Portal.

Downloads
--------------

There are [binary releases](https://renderdoc.org/builds) available, built from the release targets. If you just want to use the program and you ended up here, this is what you want :).

It's recommended that if you're new you start with the stable builds. Nightly builds are available every day from the [v1.x branch here](https://renderdoc.org/builds#nightly) if you need it, but correspondingly may be less stable.

Documentation
--------------

The text documentation is available [online for the latest stable version](https://renderdoc.org/docs/), as well as in [renderdoc.chm](https://renderdoc.org/docs/renderdoc.chm) in any build. It's built from [restructured text with sphinx](docs).

As mentioned above there are some [youtube videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/baldurkarlsson/) showing the use of some basic features and an introduction/overview.

There is also a great presentation by [@Icetigris](https://twitter.com/Icetigris) which goes into some details of how RenderDoc can be used in real world situations: [slides are up here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LQUMIld4SGoQVthnhT1scoA3k4Sg0as14G4NeSiSgFU/edit#slide=id.p).

License
--------------

RenderDoc is released under the MIT license, see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for full text as well as 3rd party library acknowledgements.

Compiling
---------

Building RenderDoc is fairly straight forward on most platforms. See [Compiling.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING/Compiling.md) for more details.
