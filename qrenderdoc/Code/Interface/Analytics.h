// This file controls the telemetry/analytics functionality in RenderDoc.
//
// If you don't care about any details and just want to make sure this is turned off for your builds
// then go below to #define RENDERDOC_ANALYTICS_ENABLE and change it to 0. That will cease all
// recording and reporting of analytics data. It won't delete any previously recorded analytics and
// won't stop any other builds from working, since the code that knows about what the analytics is
// will be compiled out.
//
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// RenderDoc's analytics works in two phases: Data is recorded first to an internal database that
// can contain more information than will be sent, to allow for accurate tracking before
// aggregation. This isn't as scary as it sounds - e.g. consider the 'UsageLevel' stat that's
// reported, which is a number in the range 1 to 31 indicating how many days in the month the
// program was launched. In order to track that, we need to have a sticky flag for each day to count
// it, since given a number "20" it's impossible to know if we've counted today or not.
//
// Similar cases are found for averages that need to store the number of cases and a total, which is
// then flattened down into just an average for reporting.
//
// This database is stored internally and then converted to the report in the 'AnalyticsSerialise'
// function.
//
// Once the report is sent, the database is reset and begins the next period.

// this is the root switch that can turn off *all* analytics code globally
#define RENDERDOC_ANALYTICS_ENABLE 1

// we don't want any of this to be accessible to script, only code.
#if !defined(SWIG) && !defined(SWIG_GENERATED)

// We also compile out all of the code if analytics are disabled so there's not even a code
// reference to where the data is collected.
