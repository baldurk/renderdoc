DOCUMENT(R"(The basic irreducible type of an object. Every other more complex type is built on these.

.. data:: Chunk

  A 'special' type indicating that the object is a chunk. A chunk can be treated like a
  :data:`Struct` otherwise. See :class:`SDChunk`.

.. data:: Struct

  A composite type with some number of children of different types, each child with its own name.
  May in some cases be empty, so the presence of children should not be assumed.

.. data:: Array

  A composite type with some number of children with an identical type and referred to purely by
  their index in the array. May be empty.

.. data:: Null

  An indicator that an object could be here, but is optional and is currently not present. See
  :data:`SDTypeFlags.Nullable`.

.. data:: Buffer

  An opaque byte buffer.

.. data:: String

  A string, encoded as UTF-8.

.. data:: Enum

  An enum value - stored as an integer but with a distinct set of possible named values.

.. data:: UnsignedInteger

  An unsigned integer.

.. data:: SignedInteger

  An signed integer.

.. data:: Float

  A floating point value.

.. data:: Boolean

  A boolean true/false value.

.. data:: Character

  A single byte character. Wide/multi-byte characters are not supported (these would be stored as a
  string with 1 character and multiple bytes in UTF-8).

  This type has no special properties.

.. data:: HasCustomString

  This type has a custom string. This could be used for example for enums, to display the string
  value of the enum as well as the integer storage, or perhaps for opaque types that should be
  displayed to the user as a string even if the underlying representation is not a string.

.. data:: Hidden

  This type is considered an implementation detail and should not typically be displayed to the user.

.. data:: Nullable

  This type is nullable and can sometimes be removed and replaced simply with a Null type. See
  :data:`SDBasic.Null`.

.. data:: NullString

  Special flag to indicate that this is a C-string which was NULL, not just empty.
