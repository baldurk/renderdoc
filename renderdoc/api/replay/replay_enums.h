  A single-precision (32-bit) floating point value. This is an IEEE float with 1 sign bit,
  8 bits of exponent and 23 bits of mantissa.

.. data:: UNorm

  An unsigned normalised floating point value. This is converted by dividing the input value by
  the maximum representable unsigned integer value, to produce a value in the range ``[0, 1]``

.. data:: SNorm

  A signed normalised floating point value in range. This is converted by dividing the input value
  by the maximum representable *positive signed* integer value, to produce a value in the range
  ``[-1, 1]``. As a special case, the maximum negative signed integer is also mapped to ``-1`` so
  there are two representations of -1. This means there is only one ``0`` value and that there is
  the same range of available values for positive and negative values.

  For example, signed 16-bit integers range from ``-32768`` to ``+32767``. ``-32768`` is mapped to
  ``-1``, and then any other value is divided by ``32767`` giving an equal set of values in the

DOCUMENT(R"(Annotates a particular built-in input or output from a shader with a special meaning to
the hardware or API.

Some of the built-in inputs or outputs can be declared multiple times in arrays or otherwise indexed
to apply to multiple related things - see :data:`ClipDistance`, :data:`CullDistance` and
:data:`ColorOutput`.

.. data:: Undefined

  Undefined built-in or no built-in is attached to this shader variable.

.. data:: Position

  As an output from the final vertex processing shader stage, this feeds the vertex position to the
  rasterized. As an input to the pixel shader stage this receives the position from the rasterizer.

.. data:: PointSize

  An output that controls the size of point primitives.

.. data:: ClipDistance

  An output for the distance to a user-defined clipping plane. Any pixel with an interpolated value
  that is negative will not be rasterized. Typically there can be more than one such output.

.. data:: CullDistance

  An output for the distance to a user-defined culling plane. Any primitive with all vertices having
  negative values will not be rasterized. Typically there can be more than one such output.

.. data:: RTIndex

  An output for selecting the render target index in an array to render to. Available in geometry
  shaders and possibly earlier stages depending on hardware/API capability.

.. data:: ViewportIndex

  An output for selecting the viewport index to render to. Available in geometry shaders and
  possibly earlier stages depending on hardware/API capability.

.. data:: VertexIndex

  An input to the vertex shader listing the vertex index. The exact meaning of this index can vary
  by API but generally it refers to either a 0-based counter for non-indexed draws, or the index
  value for indexed draws. It may or may not be affected by offsets, depending on API semantics.

.. data:: PrimitiveIndex

  A built-in indicating which primitive is being processed. This can be read by all primitive stages
  after the vertex shader, and written by the geometry shader.

.. data:: InstanceIndex

  This built-in is defined similar to :data:`VertexIndex` but for instances within an instanced
  drawcall. It counts from 0 and as with :data:`VertexIndex` it may or may not be affected by
  drawcall offsets.

.. data:: DispatchSize

  An input in compute shaders that gives the number of workgroups executed by the dispatch call.

.. data:: DispatchThreadIndex

  An input in compute shaders giving a 3D shared index across all workgroups, such that the index
  varies across each thread in the workgroup up to its size, then the indices for workgroup
  ``(0,0,1)`` begin adjacent to where workgroup ``(0,0,0)`` ended.

  This is related to :data:`GroupThreadIndex` and :data:`GroupIndex`.

.. data:: GroupIndex

  An input in compute shaders giving a 3D index of this current workgroup amongst all workgroups,
  up to the dispatch size.

  The index is constant across all threads in the workgroup.

  This is related to :data:`GroupThreadIndex` and :data:`DispatchThreadIndex`.

.. data:: GroupFlatIndex

  An input in compute shaders giving a flat 1D index of the thread within the current workgroup.
  This index increments first in the ``X`` dimension, then in the ``Y`` dimension, then in the ``Z``
  dimension.

.. data:: GroupThreadIndex

  An input in compute shaders giving a 3D index of this thread within its workgroup, up to the
  workgroup size.

  The input does not vary between one thread in a workgroup and the same thread in another
  workgroup.

  This is related to :data:`GroupIndex` and :data:`DispatchThreadIndex`.

.. data:: GSInstanceIndex

  An input to the geometry shader giving the instance being run, if the geometry shader was setup to
  be invoked multiple times for each input primitive.

.. data:: OutputControlPointIndex

  An input to the tessellation control or hull shader giving the output control point index or patch
  vertex being operated on.

.. data:: DomainLocation

  An input to the tessellation evaluation or domain shader, giving the normalised location on the
  output patch where evaluation is occuring. E.g. for triangle output this is the barycentric
  co-ordinates of the output vertex.

.. data:: IsFrontFace

  An input to the pixel shader indicating whether or not the contributing triangle was considered
  front-facing or not according to the API setup for winding order and backface orientation.

.. data:: MSAACoverage

  An input or an output from the pixel shader. As an input, it specifies a bitmask of which samples
  in a pixel were covered by the rasterizer. As an output, it specifies which samples in the
  destination target should be updated.

.. data:: MSAASamplePosition

  An input to the pixel shader that contains the location of the current sample relative to the
  pixel, when running the pixel shader at sample frequency.

)"
         R"(
.. data:: MSAASampleIndex

  An input to the pixel shader that indicates which sample in the range ``0 .. N-1`` is currently
  being processed.

.. data:: PatchNumVertices

  An input to the tessellation stages, this gives the number of vertices in each patch.

.. data:: OuterTessFactor

  An output from the tessellation control or hull shader, this determines the level to which the
  outer edge of each primitive is tessellated by the fixed-function tessellator.

  It is also available for reading in the tessellation evaluation or domain shader.

.. data:: InsideTessFactor

  Related to :data:`OuterTessFactor` this functions in the same way to determine the tessellation
  level inside the primitive.

.. data:: ColorOutput

  An output from the pixel shader, this determines the color value written to the corresponding
  target. There will be as many color output built-ins as there are targets bound.

.. data:: DepthOutput

  An output from the pixel shader, writes the depth of this pixel with no restrictions.

  Related to :data:`DepthOutputGreaterEqual` and :data:`DepthOutputLessEqual`.

.. data:: DepthOutputGreaterEqual

  An output from the pixel shader, writes the depth of this pixel with the restriction that it will
  be greater than or equal to the original depth produced by the rasterizer.

  Related to :data:`DepthOutput` and :data:`DepthOutputLessEqual`.

.. data:: DepthOutputLessEqual

  An output from the pixel shader, writes the depth of this pixel with the restriction that it will
  be less than or equal to the original depth produced by the rasterizer.

  This overlay renders the image in greyscale using a simple luminosity calculation, then highlights
  any pixels that are ``NaN`` in red, any that are positive or negative infinity in green, and any
  that are negative in blue.

.. data:: Clipping

  This overlay renders the image in greyscale using a simple luminosity calculation, then highlights
  any pixels that are currently above the white point in green and any pixels that are below the
  black point in red.

  This is relative to the current black and white points used to display the texture.

.. data:: ClearBeforePass

  This overlay clears the bound render targets before the current pass, allowing you to see only the
  contribution from the current pass.

  Note only color targets are cleared, depth-stencil targets are unchanged so any depth or stencil
  tests will still pass or fail in the same way.

.. data:: ClearBeforeDraw

  This is the same as the :data:`ClearBeforePass` overlay, except it clears before the current
  drawcall, not the current pass.

.. data:: QuadOverdrawPass

  This overlay shows pixel overdraw using 2x2 rasterized quad granularity instead of single-pixel
  overdraw. This represents the number of times the pixel shader was invoked along triangle edges
  even if each pixel is only overdrawn once.

  The overlay accounts for all draws in the current pass.

.. data:: QuadOverdrawDraw

  This is the same as the :data:`QuadOverdrawPass` overlay, except it only shows the overdraw for
  the current drawcall, not the current pass.

.. data:: TriangleSizePass

  This overlay shows the size of each triangle, starting from triangles with area ``16 (4x4)`` and above
  at the lower end to triangles with area ``0.125 (1/8th pixel)`` at the upper end.

  The overlay accounts for all draws in the current pass.

.. data:: TriangleSizeDraw

  This is similar to the :data:`TriangleSizePass` overlay, except it only shows the triangle size
  for the current drawcall, not the current pass.
