  An unsigned normalised floating point value. This is converted by dividing the input value by

.. data:: SNorm

  A signed normalised floating point value in range. This is converted by dividing the input value

  there are two representations of -1. This means there is only one ``0`` value and that there is
  the same range of available values for positive and negative values.

  For example, signed 16-bit integers range from ``-32768`` to ``+32767``. ``-32768`` is mapped to
  ``-1``, and then any other value is divided by ``32767`` giving an equal set of values in the

DOCUMENT(R"(The type of overlay image to render on top of an existing texture view, for debugging
purposes.

In overlays that refer to the 'current pass', for any API that does not have an explicit notion of a
render pass, it is defined as all previous drawcalls that render to the same set of render targets.
Note that this is defined independently from any marker regions.

See :ref:`the documentation for this feature <render-overlay>`.

.. data:: NoOverlay

  No overlay should be rendered.

.. data:: Drawcall

  An overlay highlighting the area rasterized by the drawcall on screen, no matter what tests or
  processes may be discarding the pixels actually rendered.

  The rest of the image should be dimmed slightly to make the draw on screen clearer.

.. data:: Wireframe

  Similar to the :data:`Drawcall` overlay, this should render over the top of the image, but showing
  the wireframe of the object instead of a solid render.

.. data:: Depth

  This overlay shows pixels from the object that passed all depth tests in green, and pixels that
  failed any depth test in red.

  If some pixel is overwritten more than once by the object, if any of the samples passed the result
  will be green (i.e. the failure overlay is conservative).

.. data:: Stencil

  This overlay shows pixels from the object that passed all stencil tests in green, and pixels that
  failed any stencil test in red.

  If some pixel is overwritten more than once by the object, if any of the samples passed the result
  will be green (i.e. the failure overlay is conservative).

.. data:: BackfaceCull

  This overlay shows pixels from the object that passed backface culling in green, and pixels that
  were backface culled in red.

  If some pixel is overwritten more than once by the object, if any of the samples passed the result
  will be green (i.e. the failure overlay is conservative).

.. data:: ViewportScissor

  This overlay shows a rectangle on screen corresponding to both the current viewport, and if
  enabled the current scissor as well.

.. data:: NaN

  This overlay renders the image in greyscale using a simple luminosity calculation, then highlights
  any pixels that are ``NaN`` in red, any that are positive or negative infinity in green, and any
  that are negative in blue.

.. data:: Clipping

  This overlay renders the image in greyscale using a simple luminosity calculation, then highlights
  any pixels that are currently above the white point in green and any pixels that are below the
  black point in red.

  This is relative to the current black and white points used to display the texture.

.. data:: ClearBeforePass

  This overlay clears the bound render targets before the current pass, allowing you to see only the
  contribution from the current pass.

  Note only color targets are cleared, depth-stencil targets are unchanged so any depth or stencil
  tests will still pass or fail in the same way.

.. data:: ClearBeforeDraw

  This is the same as the :data:`ClearBeforePass` overlay, except it clears before the current
  drawcall, not the current pass.

.. data:: QuadOverdrawPass

  This overlay shows pixel overdraw using 2x2 rasterized quad granularity instead of single-pixel
  overdraw. This represents the number of times the pixel shader was invoked along triangle edges
  even if each pixel is only overdrawn once.

  The overlay accounts for all draws in the current pass.

.. data:: QuadOverdrawDraw

  This is the same as the :data:`QuadOverdrawPass` overlay, except it only shows the overdraw for
  the current drawcall, not the current pass.

.. data:: TriangleSizePass

  This overlay shows the size of each triangle, starting from triangles with area ``16 (4x4)`` and above
  at the lower end to triangles with area ``0.125 (1/8th pixel)`` at the upper end.

  The overlay accounts for all draws in the current pass.

  for the current drawcall, not the current pass.

.. data:: EAC

  A block-compressed texture in ``EAC`` format, expanded from ``ETC2``.

  Commonly used on mobile or embedded platforms.

  The single and dual channel formats encode 11-bit data with 0.5 bytes per channel (so
  the single channel format is 0.5 bytes per pixel total, and the dual channel format is 1 byte per
  pixel total). The four channel format is encoded similarly to ETC2 for the base RGB data and
  similarly to the single channel format for the alpha, giving 1 byte per pixel total.
  See :data:`ETC2`.

.. data:: ASTC

  A block-compressed texture in ``ASTC`` format (Representation varies a lot)

  The ASTC format encodes each block as 16 bytes, but the block size can vary from 4x4 (so 1 byte
  per pixel) up to 12x12 (0.11 bytes per pixel).

  Each block can encode between one and three channels of data, either correlated or uncorrelated,
  in low or high dynamic range.

  Commonly used on mobile or embedded platforms.

DOCUMENT(R"(A set of flags describing the properties of a particular action. An action is a call
such as a draw, a compute dispatch, clears, copies, resolves, etc. Any GPU event which may have
deliberate visible side-effects to application-visible memory, typically resources such as textures
and buffers. It also includes markers, which provide a user-generated annotation of events and
actions.

.. data:: NoFlags

  The action has no special properties.

.. data:: Clear

  The action is a clear call. See :data:`ClearColor` and :data:`ClearDepthStencil`.

.. data:: Drawcall

  The action renders primitives using the graphics pipeline.

.. data:: Dispatch

  The action issues a number of compute workgroups.

.. data:: MeshDispatch

  The action issues a number of mesh groups for a draw.

.. data:: CmdList

  The action calls into a previously recorded child command list.

.. data:: SetMarker

  The action inserts a single debugging marker.

.. data:: PushMarker

  The action begins a debugging marker region that has children.

.. data:: PopMarker

  The action ends a debugging marker region.

.. data:: Present

  The action is a presentation call that hands a swapchain image to the presentation engine.

.. data:: MultiAction

  The action is a multi-action that contains several specified child actions. Typically a MultiDraw
  or ExecuteIndirect on D3D12.

.. data:: Copy

  The action performs a resource copy operation.

.. data:: Resolve

  The action performs a resource resolve or blit operation.

.. data:: GenMips

  The action performs a resource mip-generation operation.

.. data:: PassBoundary

  The action marks the beginning or end of a render pass. See :data:`BeginPass` and
  :data:`EndPass`.

.. data:: Indexed

  The action uses an index buffer.

.. data:: Instanced

  The action uses instancing. This does not mean it renders more than one instanced, simply that
  it uses the instancing feature.

.. data:: Auto

  The action interacts with stream-out to render all vertices previously written. This is a
  Direct3D 11 specific feature.

.. data:: Indirect

  The action uses a buffer on the GPU to source some or all of its parameters in an indirect way.

.. data:: ClearColor

  The action clears a color target.

.. data:: ClearDepthStencil

  The action clears a depth-stencil target.

.. data:: BeginPass

  The action marks the beginning of a render pass.

.. data:: EndPass

  The action marks the end of a render pass.

  The action is a virtual marker added to show command buffer boundaries.
