// Build configuration variables.
//
// When distributing RenderDoc builds please check these variables before building and
// set them appropriately. If you're building locally, the defaults are all fine.
//
// For windows builds, some of these variables are irrelevant and can be ignored.
//
// For non-windows builds, these variables have cmake settings that you can use to set
// them, and are designed to be set that way. See BUILD_VERSION_*.
//
// However if you want to you can locally modify this file (e.g. copy a file with some fixed values
// set, then just update the version numbers in the build process).
//

// To prevent a project rebuild cascading when the git commit changes, we declare a char array
// that's implemented in version.cpp, which is linked into the core module.
// It's 41 characters to allow 40 characters of commit hash plus trailing NULL.
// Then version.cpp is the only thing that needs to be rebuilt when the git commit changes
//
// Only available internally, external users should use RENDERDOC_GetCommitHash()
#if defined(RENDERDOC_EXPORTS)

// If this variable is set to 1, then this build is considered a stable version - based on a tagged
// version number upstream, possibly with some patches applied as necessary.
// Any other build whether it's including experimental local changes or just from the tip of the
// latest code at some other point should be considered unstable and leave this as 0.
