# Asking questions

Sometimes you have a general question that you'd like to ask which isn't exactly a bug or a feature request.

In these cases, filing an issue on github isn't generally the best way to do it since questions might turn into a conversation or a discussion and don't have a defined scope.

Instead these questions can be asked in one of RenderDoc's community spaces, such as in [#renderdoc on OFTC IRC](https://webchat.oftc.net/?channels=renderdoc) or on RenderDoc's [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ahq6yRB). If your question is more private you can [email me directly at baldurk@baldurk.org](mailto:baldurk@baldurk.org).

Please note that in all these places RenderDoc's [code of conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) still applies.
