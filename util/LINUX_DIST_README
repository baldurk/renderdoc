About:
------

RenderDoc is a debugger for graphics APIs, currently supporting OpenGL
and Vulkan. This package contains the headless utility tool
'renderdoccmd' which can be used to capture applications, as well as a
work-in-progress version of the Qt UI 'qrenderdoc'.

The directory structure in the package matches how it should be
installed, most commonly under /usr but this is up to you.

After installation if you'd like to register the desktop files like
thumbnailer, shortcut, icons, etc, you'll need something along the lines
of these commands as root:

# update-desktop-database
# update-menus
# update-mime-database /usr/share/mime/
# gtk-update-icon-cache /usr/share/icons/hicolor/

Documentation is available online at https://renderdoc.org/docs and more
information in general is available on the github repository and wiki -

Requirements:
-------------

* libxcb
* libX11
* libX11-xcb
* libGL

These should be available on any system with X installed. You can always
build RenderDoc yourself from source. For more information, github.

To run qrenderdoc, Qt is statically linked two additional system
libraries are needed:

* libfontconfig
* libfreetype

Vulkan Layer registration:
--------------------------

RenderDoc cannot capture Vulkan when run from binary without any
installation. Any installed package from a distribution or otherwise is
expected to have registered the Vulkan layer as appropriate, but if you
are running binaries loose then the renderdoccmd utility will prompt you
to register the layer. This involves placing an appropriate .json file
under $HOME/.local/vulkan, or optionally in /etc if desired (and if the
tool is run with appropriate permissions).
